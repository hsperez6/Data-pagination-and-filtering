# Data-pagination-and-filtering
 
In this project, I used vanilla Javascript to display student information from an array of student objects. I used separate functions to both display the first nine students and to add pagination buttons to better navigate and present the information. Lastly, I added a search option to further enhance the usability of the web page.
